When I was younger, my first ever dip into programming was with JavaScript, albeit I never really stood knee deep in it. My first project that was written in JavaScript was first built using the Scratch platform, and then converted into JavaScript. I ended up doing a couple lessons on FreeCodeCamp so that I could learn how to make adjustments to the code generated by Scratch. When I heard that ICS 314, our Software Engineering class, would be taught using JavaScript, I took the opportunity to brush up on the language over the winter break.

## Jumping Hurdles
JavaScript at first, was difficult to learn due to the syntax, but still felt familiar as I was accustomed to coding in Java and C/C++ from my previous experiences. One of the biggest hurdles to jump over was not having types in JavaScript. In Java and C/C++, you declare variables using data types such as “int”, “boolean”, “String”, and “double” etc. However, in JavaScript, you would use the “let”, “const”, or “var” keywords. This was something I found hard to get used to and oftentimes I’d hit “run code” before I realized my mistakes. Although sometimes I’d find it annoying, I actually think that the dynamic aspect of variables in JavaScript is really interesting and unique. In the past week, I learned a lot about JavaScript, especially in regards to ES6. At first, the syntax for arrow functions were a little intimidating and scary as a newbie in JavaScript, but I’m sure as I write more robust programs in the future, the features that ES6 adds to JavaScript will prove to be very useful. In my opinion, I think that JavaScript is good for learning foundations, and it can be a powerful tool in software development, especially in combination with libraries such as JQuery and React.

## A Sprint to Success
“Athletic Software Engineering” was a term I’ve never heard before taking ICS 314. You can read more about athletic software engineering [here](https://philipmjohnson.org/essays/ase-2017.html). Something that I always worried about as a Computer Science student were the coding interview questions. I appreciate the “Workout of the Day”, or WODs, that we get to do in this class because they mimic the coding interview questions by telling us to complete similar coding challenges under timed conditions. Personally, I’ve found the practice WODs to be very useful as I love a good challenge. They are challenging enough that I can’t immediately come up with a solution as soon as I see the problem, but I am able to solve them within average time. I also enjoy working against the clock, since it pushes me to think quickly. When I make a mistake, I also have to think quickly on how to fix it. Something I found interesting while practicing the WODs was that I am starting to notice my coding habits. For example, I will write code explicitly, which causes me to write more code. For instance, instead of using a ternary operator to write a conditional statement, which would be more concise and quicker to write, I will write if/else blocks. Now I know that I should probably start practicing shorthand operations to become a faster programmer!
