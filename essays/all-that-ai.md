### I. Introduction
In education, many teachers have banned the use of AI for class assignments. The main concern over using AI is using it to cheat or plagiarize. However, I believe that AI should not be completely banned from education. Besides, many students find workarounds or will use it anyways. ChatGPT is one of the most well-known and widely used AI tools used by students, including myself. In software engineering, ChatGPT proves to be very useful in providing code that does what you want. However, it is important to note that AI does not give you answers, it only gives you predictions. Sometimes these predictions are accurate, but it still requires you to know whether or not it is true. In that sense, I believe you still need to learn things without AI in order for you to make that determination. I think that as long as you use AI ethically and responsible, it can be a powerful tool to aide in your education.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
Reflect on your personal experiences with AI technologies within ICS 314. Provide specific examples of how you have used AI or explanations as to why you have not used AI (e.g. “I tried it for xxx and found it did not give useful results” or “I thought it important for me to find an answer on my own.”) for each of the following course elements:

Be sure give specific examples including what prompts you used. For example:

For the Functional programming WOD I asked ChatGPT “Write a function using underscore to implement the following instructions <WOD instructions here>”

For each example, discuss how useful AI was (or was not useful) and the benefits and costs of using it in each example e.g. “I would not know how to start without ChatGPT, but the result was not exactly what was needed and it took a lot of time with trial and error to get a workable result.”.

IMPORTANT Again, if you did not use AI for a course element listed, discuss why you did not, especially if you tried to use AI but found it not helpful or not worth the effort. Do not simply list “I din’t use AI for this element.”

I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. **Experience WODs e.g. E18:**
    - For the Experience WODs, aka the HW WODs, I used some AI. When it comes to my learning style, I am the type who learns best by doing and making mistakes. It is the challenge to figure out a solution on my own that motivates me and teaches me the most. Most of the time, if I ever got stuck, following the provided videos were more than enough for me to learn how to do something. However, sometimes I run into errors I don't know how to fix. For instance, while learning JavaScript, I'd run into Uncaught TypeError or ReferenceError. I didn't know what these meant so I would ask ChatGPT about them and use ChatGPT as debugger tool.

2. **In-class Practice WODs:** 
    - For the in-class practice WODs, I did not use AI. Since all of these WODs were based off the HW WODs and I always completed those WODs on time, I did not use AI because I knew how to do them. I always had enough examples from my homework to be able to reference them during the practice WODs. For me, I did not try to finish the practice WODs quickly since they weren't graded anyways. I used them more as an opportunity to develop my skills on my own without trying to get it under a certain time limit.

3. **In-class WODs:**  
    - For the in-class WODs, I did not use AI. I felt that the HW WODs and practice WODs were sufficient enough in teaching me the skills and concepts I needed to succeed in the in-class WODs. I always referred back to my previous coding assignments and online guides to assist me. 

4. **Essays:**
    - For the essays, I used some AI. When it comes to the content of the essay itself, I never asked ChatGPT to write me anything. I felt that it was important to use my own voice and knowledge to write about what I know. I would use ChatGPT to brainstorm titles and headers using sections of my essay. For instance, one question I asked was, "come up with some fun titles for a blog post about ESLint". Most of the titles and headers were pretty trash, but I would pick out words from different titles and headers to make my own. 

5. **Final project:**
    - For the final project, I used AI quite a bit. For the majority of my work, I felt that the skills and concepts I learned from class were enough to code most of my tasks. Something I used ChatGPT a lot for was finding the correct Bootstrap classes or components to use. If I was spending a long time aligning components, I would ask ChatGPT something like "how can i align xxx in such a way..." along with my code. I would always get confused over what certain classes were called, so I would type them wrong and ChatGPT would correct me. I also use ChatGPT to help me with figuring out code that I didn't learn how to code before. For example, in my final project I was responsible for coding the trade mechanics that allowed for two cards to swap owners. I didn't learn much about collections and databases, so I didn't know exactly how to go about it. When I asked ChatGPT, it wrote Meteor method, which allows communication from frontend to backend to modify a database. Through ChatGPT I learned a lot about how to implement my own Meteor methods.

6. **Learning a concept / tutorial:**
    - For learning a concept or tutorial, I used some AI. When learning JavaScript, I wanted to prepare more beyond just doing the HW and practice WODs. I asked ChatGPT questions like "provide me practice problems to learn underscore functions".

7. **Answering a question in class or in Discord:**
    - For answering a question in class or in Discord, I did not use AI.

8. **Asking or answering a smart-question:**
    - For asking or answering a smart question, I did not use AI.

9. **Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”:**
    - For coding examples, I used some AI. Like mentioned above, I used AI to generate examples to help me learn concepts. Sometimes I needed extra help and practice, and it was a quick and easy way to generate problems. 

10. **Explaining code:**
    - For explaining code, I used some AI. Sometimes, if a chunk of code has a lot going on, I would use AI to help me break it down. I did not really have to do this often, but if it's something someone else wrote, then I found that ChatGPT did a good job of explaining what each part does.

11. **Writing code:**
    - For writing code, I used some AI. Like mentioned above, I used AI to write code for concepts I did not have a lot of experience with through the class assignments.

12. **Documenting code:**
    - For documenting code, I did not use AI. I felt that it was important for me to go through my code myself and document it. This way, I could get a better understanding of my code and I knew personally what the user should know about it. 

13. **Quality assurance:**
    - For quality assurance, I used some AI. If I ran into errors I couldn't solve on my own, I would use ChatGPT to look over my code. Googling the error message sometimes would not give me a clear answer on how to fix, especially since the errors aren't in the same context of what I'm trying to code. I found that ChatGPT was faster for me to use to help me debug.

14. **Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above:**
    - Other than the aforementioned categories, I cannot think of any other uses of AI in ICS 314.
