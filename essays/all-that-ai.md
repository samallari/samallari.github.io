### I. Introduction
In education, many teachers have banned the use of AI for class assignments. The main concern over using AI is using it to cheat or plagiarize. However, I believe that AI should not be completely banned from education. Besides, many students find workarounds or will use it anyways. ChatGPT is one of the most well-known and widely used AI tools used by students, including myself. In software engineering, ChatGPT proves to be very useful in providing code that does what you want. However, it is important to note that AI does not give you answers, it only gives you predictions. Sometimes these predictions are accurate, but it still requires you to know whether or not it is true. In that sense, I believe you still need to learn things without AI in order for you to make that determination. I think that as long as you use AI ethically and responsible, it can be a powerful tool to aide in your education.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. **Experience WODs e.g. E18:**
    - For the Experience WODs, aka the HW WODs, I used some AI. When it comes to my learning style, I am the type who learns best by doing and making mistakes. It is the challenge to figure out a solution on my own that motivates me and teaches me the most. Most of the time, if I ever got stuck, following the provided videos were more than enough for me to learn how to do something. However, sometimes I run into errors I don't know how to fix. For instance, while learning JavaScript, I'd run into Uncaught TypeError or ReferenceError. I didn't know what these meant so I would ask ChatGPT about them and use ChatGPT as debugger tool.

2. **In-class Practice WODs:** 
    - For the in-class practice WODs, I did not use AI. Since all of these WODs were based off the HW WODs and I always completed those WODs on time, I did not use AI because I knew how to do them. I always had enough examples from my homework to be able to reference them during the practice WODs. For me, I did not try to finish the practice WODs quickly since they weren't graded anyways. I used them more as an opportunity to develop my skills on my own without trying to get it under a certain time limit.

3. **In-class WODs:**  
    - For the in-class WODs, I did not use AI. I felt that the HW WODs and practice WODs were sufficient enough in teaching me the skills and concepts I needed to succeed in the in-class WODs. I always referred back to my previous coding assignments and online guides to assist me. 

4. **Essays:**
    - For the essays, I used some AI. When it comes to the content of the essay itself, I never asked ChatGPT to write me anything. I felt that it was important to use my own voice and knowledge to write about what I know. I would use ChatGPT to brainstorm titles and headers using sections of my essay. For instance, one question I asked was, "come up with some fun titles for a blog post about ESLint". Most of the titles and headers were pretty trash, but I would pick out words from different titles and headers to make my own. 

5. **Final project:**
    - For the final project, I used AI quite a bit. For the majority of my work, I felt that the skills and concepts I learned from class were enough to code most of my tasks. Something I used ChatGPT a lot for was finding the correct Bootstrap classes or components to use. If I was spending a long time aligning components, I would ask ChatGPT something like "how can i align xxx in such a way..." along with my code. I would always get confused over what certain classes were called, so I would type them wrong and ChatGPT would correct me. I also use ChatGPT to help me with figuring out code that I didn't learn how to code before. For example, in my final project I was responsible for coding the trade mechanics that allowed for two cards to swap owners. I didn't learn much about collections and databases, so I didn't know exactly how to go about it. When I asked ChatGPT, it wrote Meteor method, which allows communication from frontend to backend to modify a database. Through ChatGPT I learned a lot about how to implement my own Meteor methods.

6. **Learning a concept / tutorial:**
    - For learning a concept or tutorial, I used some AI. When learning JavaScript, I wanted to prepare more beyond just doing the HW and practice WODs. I asked ChatGPT questions like "provide me practice problems to learn underscore functions".

7. **Answering a question in class or in Discord:**
    - For answering a question in class or in Discord, I did not use AI. Most of the time, I did not really know how to answer the questions, so I felt that it was not valuable for me to answer, since I would probably end up suggesting something that wasn't right. I also figured that students probably already tried to ask AI before asking the class.  

8. **Asking or answering a smart-question:**
    - For asking or answering a smart question, I did not use AI for the same reasons as above.

9. **Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”:**
    - For coding examples, I used some AI. Like mentioned above, I used AI to generate examples to help me learn concepts. Sometimes I needed extra help and practice, and it was a quick and easy way to generate problems. 

10. **Explaining code:**
    - For explaining code, I used some AI. Sometimes, if a chunk of code has a lot going on, I would use AI to help me break it down. I did not really have to do this often, but if it's something someone else wrote, then I found that ChatGPT did a good job of explaining what each part does.

11. **Writing code:**
    - For writing code, I used some AI. Like mentioned above, I used AI to write code for concepts I did not have a lot of experience with through the class assignments.

12. **Documenting code:**
    - For documenting code, I did not use AI. I felt that it was important for me to go through my code myself and document it. This way, I could get a better understanding of my code and I knew personally what the user should know about it. 

13. **Quality assurance:**
    - For quality assurance, I used some AI. If I ran into errors I couldn't solve on my own, I would use ChatGPT to look over my code. Googling the error message sometimes would not give me a clear answer on how to fix, especially since the errors aren't in the same context of what I'm trying to code. I found that ChatGPT was faster for me to use to help me debug.

14. **Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above:**
    - Other than the aforementioned categories, I cannot think of any other uses of AI in ICS 314.


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
I think that AI has become a valuable tool in my education. I think that it has helped a lot in my learning experience. Personally, I don't think that AI has impacted me negatively. In the beginning, when I was first introduced to AI, the first class that I used it in was my Discrete Math 1 class. I found that class to be very difficult since it was my first math heavy computer science course, and so many of the concepts were very foreign and difficult to understand and many textbooks and online resources were very math heavy. I quickly learned that ChatGPT was absolutely terrible for finding problem answers, but it was perfect for explaining challenging concepts in a simple, easy-to-understand way. In software engineering, I found AI to be very useful in the same way, it was great for teaching me concepts I couldn't understand on my own. When it comes to problem-solving and skill development, I have never gone to ChatGPT without making an attempt on my own first. It is because of this that I believe that I am still learning (not cheating) even while using AI.

### IV. Practical Applications:
Personally, I think there are a lot of cool applications of AI, but there are also a lot of dangerous applications. I am not entirely knowledgeable on AI, but it is a field I would like to learn more about and explore. 

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
I did not really have a lot of challenges using AI within the course. The only issues I've found, is that without the full context of your code and other files, ChatGPT may make errors in suggesting code, and so it takes more questions and time to figure out how to integrate what ChatGPT said into your project. 

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
While I was an LA for ICS 111, the professor allowed students to use AI as long as they were able provide an "AI Diary". This is a log of the chat between the student and the AI, and included a reflection/explanation of what was said during the chat. This way, even if the student asked for an answer, the student needed to understand why that answer is correct. I think that the reflection portion dissuaded some students from using AI and made them do it the traditional way, but those who did use AI were still expected to really dig deeper into the answer and learn.

### VII. Future Considerations:
I think that AI can prove to be a powerful tool in software engineering education if used correctly. Students need to learn and understand how to use AI ethically and effectively.

### VIII. Conclusion:
In conclusion, like I said before AI does not give you answers, it only gives you predictions. Students shouldn't be banned from using AI, instead they should be taught how to use AI responsibly and ethically. This should start from introductory course such as 111, so that these students can learn and practice how to use AI throughout their college careers. Learning to use AI intelligently leads to better and more productive software engineers.
