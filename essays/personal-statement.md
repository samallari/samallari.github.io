Growing up with a brother with a developmental disability meant that I could witness firsthand how technology has made an impact on his life. From providing him an education that caters to his needs, to allowing him to socialize with others, to making it easier to manage his diabetes on his own, technology has granted him a sense of independence and has empowered him in many ways. He has inspired my interests in software engineering, machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI), and natural language processing (NLP) with a focus on their applications in education, healthcare, and social good, with the ultimate goal of engineering data-driven solutions that enhance the daily lives of others.

From a young age, I have always been captivated by the transformative power of technology. As it continues to evolve and revolutionize how we interact with one another and the world around us, my fascination with the ways humans interact with technology has only grown. In todayâ€™s society, as artificial intelligence becomes more and more integrated into everyday life, I am drawn to the challenges and opportunities of human-centered artificial intelligence. My passion is fueled by my desire to develop reliable and trustworthy AI systems that people can depend on.

In particular, I am deeply passionate about natural language processing and large language models. Language is the primary tool used by humans to convey thoughts, feelings, and information to others. It is such a huge part of culture and how we interact with one another, which is why I find replicating this in machines to be very intriguing. I aspire to integrate these technologies into innovative solutions that create unique, personalized user interfaces and transformative experiences. <img width="175px" style="float: right;" src="../img/breaking-barriers/neural.png">

As I progress in my educational and professional journey, I aim to deepen my expertise in these fields to develop innovative solutions that bridge the gap between human needs and technological possibilities. I am eager to embrace the challenges and opportunities ahead, confident that my passion for human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence will enable me to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of technology and its positive impact on society.
