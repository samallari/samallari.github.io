## ProfTCG: Collect and trade your favorite UH Manoa professor!
ProfTCG is a simple trading card web application where users can open card packs, trade with friends, and learn more about their UH Manoa professors. While studying at a large university such as UH Manoa, students can feel disconnected from their professors, whether it be due to large class sizes or even just a lack of personal interaction in small classes. As a student interested in research and graduate school, I was always interested in what my professors were working on. In large classes, I found that it can be difficult to network and make connections with professors and ask those questions directly. When talking to my team about ideas for a final project for our software engineering class, many of us shared the same sentiments. That's what brought us to come up with a professor trading card game. 

Trading card games are very popular, and this neat twist intends to bring together students and faculty in the UH Manoa community. It encourages students to make friends and bond with their classmates. Every 24 hours, students can open a card pack to receive new trading cards containing fun facts about each professor. Each trading card is unique to the current semester and copies are limited, which encourages students to check in every day to collect trading cards of varying styles and rarity. Learning more about their research and projects may inspire students interested in conducting their own research and projects to come up with ideas and seek out potential mentors.
