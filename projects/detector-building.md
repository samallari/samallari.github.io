My partner and I won first place in 2022 among ~10 other teams. We collaborated to build an electronic probe from scratch to measure the salinity of water samples using prototype materials.

Understanding that addition of salt to water increases conductivity in water and vice versa was essential for developing the probe.

I learned to program and operate an Arduino, how to design circuits/electronics, and developed basic skills in electrical engineering.
